**PayFlow** brings simplified crypto payment flows to Ethereum Layer 2, with secure Safe AA and gasless transactions

## **What is PayFlow for?**

Looking for a seamless way to manage multiple crypto payment flows?

Whether you’re a creator who wants to get supported by your fans, you’re raising funds for public goods, managing different incomes, or simply saving for some personal cause - YOU are ALL covered.

Your flow can receive payments on multiple L2 networks, you can attach an existing external wallet, or create a new one with Safe AA, and it’s gasless*.

If you need to receive a particular payment, you can create a trackable flow payment request.

Flows/requests can be shared simply as a link and QR code.

Simplify your payment flows with PayFlow!

## **What inspired me to build PayFlow?**

1. One of the most famous online banking/fintech applications in Ukraine - **[Monobank](https://www.monobank.ua/?lang=en) - has a service called “Jar”**, you can create any virtual account to **collect money for any kind of purpose**. It became one of the most used features among Ukrainian volunteers.
2. I had the **intention to support one of the Web3 technical writers** (author of amazing articles about AA and blockchain interoperability), but after a brief discussion, it became obvious there are not many Web3 native funding/supporting/buymecoffee like platforms, where you can manage multiple streams of payments and share it over social media or embed in your website.
3. **Vitalik’s article**: [The Three Transitions](https://vitalik.ca/general/2023/06/09/three_transitions.html)

## **How does PayFlow work?**

1. Sign in with Ethereum
2. Create accounts for networks to support flow wallets
3. Create a flow
4. Add either external wallets or smart wallets (Safe AA) owned by accounts
5. Share the flow on social media and receive payments
6. Create a payment request for a particular flow, wallet, and amount
7. Share payment request
8. Once paid, verify the payment
9. Withdraw funds from flows to accounts
10. Transfer funds from accounts or for a broader spectrum of operations utilize Safe Apps ecosystem.

## **What values does PayFlow stand for?**

- **Accessibility**: makes it possible for anyone to start receiving payments in crypto, regardless of their technical expertise or financial status. It empowers individuals, creators, and businesses in developing countries, where traditional financial services are often inaccessible.
- **Flexibility**: allows users to create multiple flows to collect payments for different purposes. It helps to streamline the payment process for individuals, creators, and businesses and makes it easier to track finances.
- **Permissionless**: accounts are only controlled by the user, users have complete ownership over their funds. It promotes financial freedom and self-sovereignty.
- **Multichain support**: flows can accept payments on multiple L2 networks, thus users have access to a wider range of liquidity and trading opportunities. It promotes financial inclusion and economic development.
- **Composability**: accounts are backed by Safe AA, at any point user can continue using them in Safe App, which also means that they can be used with other DeFi applications of the ecosystem. It creates new financial products and services that could benefit individuals and communities.
- **Gasless UX**: transactions are gasless, there is no initial barrier to receiving payments. It makes crypto payments more affordable and accessible to everyone.
